Hello, world!

My name is Emily Gorman and I am a senior studying Business Analytics and Applied Math at the University of Notre Dame. I am originally from Sudbury, Massachusetts, which is a suburb 20 miles west of Boston. I have two older brothers, Dan and Kevin, who graduated from Notre Dame in 2016 and 2018 respectively. I currently live off-campus in South Bend, but I will be moving to Chicago after graduation (barring any coronavirus-related complications and/or delays). One of my favorite things about Notre Dame is (or should I say, was :/ ) playing interhall and co-rec sports. With all the extra free time afforded by the quarantine restrictions, I recently learned to identify every country on a world map.
